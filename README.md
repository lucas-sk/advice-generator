### What I learned

I learned how to use the `<picture>` tag and how I can switch between two images to determine screen resolution, before I used background image and media querie to determine what the image with picture would be makes it much easier and reduces the css lines. And I also remembered how the fetch api works. I'm going to do other projects to fix this learning even more

```html
<picture>
  <source
    srcset="/images/pattern-divider-desktop.svg"
    media="(min-width: 1024px)"
  />
  <img src="./images/pattern-divider-mobile.svg" alt="" />
</picture>
```

### Useful resources

- [Boas pr√°ticas para escrever um HTML profissional - Rocketseat](https://youtu.be/TBplwrsUj4s) - This helped me to use good html skills, plus it gave me an intro about accessibility attributes and using lighthouse to check page quality.
- [picture](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) - This is an amazing article that helped me understand how to switch between two images for certain devices of different resolutions. I recommend it to anyone who is still learning this concept.
- [Buttons do not have an accessible name](https://web.dev/i18n/en/button-name/) - This is an amazing article that helped me understand how to label a button so that it is accessible to people using assistive technology.
